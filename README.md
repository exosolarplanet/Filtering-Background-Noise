# Filtering-Background-Noise
The aim of this project is to filter the background noise on a given audio file and plot the differences between the frequency responses. Initially, the file should be in .wav format or converted to .wav format. 

*example audio is thea udio_oboe.wav
*fast fourier transfrom, why do we need frequency domain? find the frequency needed to be cut
*two ways of doing: 1-lowpass function 2- transfer function from the real filter design
*in this case I used the value my team founded for the transfer function coefficients
*detailed information - as comments on code
